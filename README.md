# time-blocking-app
Time Blocking App aims to help you organize your day/week/month/year.  Time Blocking is a popular technique for studying. In its core: you block a defined amount of time for a certain activity. The main focus is that you book your time doing exactly what you have defined and want to do. No matter what percentage of the work you get done, the important thing here is the amount of time you have set aside. A way to make small progress each day without a lot of effort.
